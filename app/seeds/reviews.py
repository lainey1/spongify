# Uses a raw SQL query to TRUNCATE or DELETE the restaurants table.
# SQLAlchemy doesn't have a built-in function to do this.
# With Postgres in production, TRUNCATE removes all the data from the table,
# and RESET IDENTITY resets the auto-incrementing primary key, CASCADE deletes
# any dependent entities. With SQLite in development, use DELETE to remove
# all data and it will reset the primary keys for you as well.
